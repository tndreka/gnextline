# `get_next_line` Documentation

## Description of `get_next_line`

The `get_next_line` function reads from a file line by line. This is useful when dealing with large files and wanting to read data line by line, rather than loading the entire file into memory at once. The core of the function involves using a static buffer that accumulates data read from a file descriptor, and then processes it to extract lines.

## Key Concepts

1. **File Descriptors**: A file descriptor is a low-level identifier that the operating system uses to access files. The `get_next_line` function relies on this concept to read data from the file.

2. **Static Buffer**: A static buffer is used to store the data read from the file. This buffer persists across multiple function calls, which is essential for reading data incrementally across different calls to `get_next_line`.

3. **Reading Data**: The function uses the `read` system call to read data from the file descriptor. Data is read in chunks and stored in the buffer for processing.

4. **Newline Detection**: The function scans the buffer for a newline character (`\n`), which marks the end of a line. Once a newline is found, the line is extracted and returned.

5. **Incremental Reading**: If a newline is not found in the current buffer, the function continues to read more data from the file until it encounters either a newline or the end of the file.

6. **End of File**: When the end of the file is reached or no more data is available to read, the function will return `NULL` to indicate that there are no more lines to process.

## How the `get_next_line` Works

1. **Static Buffer**: The function uses a static buffer to accumulate data read from the file descriptor. This allows the function to remember previously read data between function calls.

2. **Reading Data with `read`**: The function reads from the file using the `read` system call, which fills the buffer with a chunk of data. This process repeats until a newline is detected or the end of the file is reached.

3. **Searching for a Newline**: Once data has been read into the buffer, the function searches for the first occurrence of a newline character (`\n`). This signifies the end of the current line.

4. **Returning the Line**: After finding the newline, the function extracts the line from the buffer, allocates memory for it, and returns it as a string. The buffer is then updated, removing the data that has already been processed.

5. **Handling Remaining Data**: If no newline is found after reading the buffer, the function will continue to read more data into the buffer. This process continues until either a newline or the end of the file is reached.

6. **End of File**: If the end of the file has been reached, or if no more data is available to read, the function returns `NULL`, indicating that there are no more lines to process.
