# Documentation for `get_next_line`

## Overview of `get_next_line`

The `get_next_line` function is designed to read lines from a file incrementally. This is particularly useful when handling large files, as it allows you to read data line by line without loading the entire file into memory at once. The core idea behind the function is to use a static buffer that accumulates data read from a file descriptor and then processes it to extract individual lines.

## Key Concepts

1. **File Descriptors**: A file descriptor is a low-level identifier used by the operating system to access files. The `get_next_line` function relies on this concept to read data from the file.
   
2. **Static Buffer**: A static buffer is used to hold the data read from the file. This buffer persists across multiple function calls, which is essential for reading data incrementally across different calls to `get_next_line`.
   
3. **Reading Data**: The function uses the `read` system call to read data from the file descriptor. Data is read in chunks and stored in the buffer for processing.

4. **Newline Detection**: The function scans the buffer for a newline character (`\n`), which marks the end of a line. Once a newline is found, the line is extracted and returned.

5. **Incremental Reading**: If no newline is found in the current buffer, the function continues to read more data from the file until either a newline or the end of the file is encountered.

6. **End of File**: When the end of the file is reached or no more data is available to read, the function returns `NULL`, signaling that there are no more lines to process.

## How the `get_next_line` Works

1. **Static Buffer**: The function uses a static buffer to accumulate data read from the file descriptor. This allows the function to remember previously read data between function calls.

2. **Reading Data with `read`**: The function reads from the file using the `read` system call, which fills the buffer with a chunk of data. This process is repeated until a newline is detected or the end of the file is reached.

3. **Searching for a Newline**: After reading data into the buffer, the function searches for the first occurrence of a newline character (`\n`). This marks the end of the current line.

4. **Returning the Line**: Once a newline is found, the function extracts the line from the buffer, allocates memory for it, and returns the line as a string. The buffer is then updated to remove the data that has already been processed.

5. **Handling Remaining Data**: If no newline is found after reading the buffer, the function will continue to read more data into the buffer, expanding it as necessary. This process continues until a newline or the end of the file is reached.

6. **End of File**: When the end of the file is reached, or if no more data can be read, the function returns `NULL`, indicating that there are no more lines to read.
